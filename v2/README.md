# README.md


On a `BSD-compatible` system, to convert and print the text file
myfile.txt to printer ps99 without a banner page, you would enter
at the Unix prompt:

  enscript -Pps99 -h myfile.txt

To make a PostScript file of the text file myfile.txt and save it
as myfile.ps, you would enter:

  enscript -pmyfile.ps myfile.txt

To redirect the output of enscript as input for another command,
append another dash to the -p option, for example:

  enscript -2rG -p- myfile.txt | psduplex | lpr -Pps99 -h

## asd asd as dsa dasdas

This will convert myfile.txt into a two-column, rotated PostScript
file with ai_large header, send it through the_ psduplex filter to
print on both sides of the paper, and finally print the result
without a banner page to the printer named ps99.
